TriviaBot v1.1

Trivia is a fun trivia bot, which can be used as a way to distract yourself and others when grinding, during raids, or when idling in one of the major cities. The author does not take any responsibility for wipes and equipment damage caused as a result of using this mod ;-)

The mod maintains a list of top scorers which is printed out after every 5th question. It also keeps speed-records for the quickest answers. It allows you to switch the channel at any point, but if you want to change the question list you will need to stop the Trivia Bot first.

This mod is based on the RaidTrivia mod by Psy on Frostwolf, the 'normal' question list is his, as are small parts of the code. The geography question set is sourced from opentrivia.com. The WoW questions I wrote myself.
